# Datastructure

⚙️ Gear Factory Datastructures

## Test

In this Repo here is a script `build.sh`, you should run this script to run your structure test on your own Linux or OSX platform.

And then you can find some executable file on the `.build` directory.

We cloud not support the Windows platform.

Enjoy yourself with `[Gear Factory Team](https://www.github.com/gearfactory)` :)
